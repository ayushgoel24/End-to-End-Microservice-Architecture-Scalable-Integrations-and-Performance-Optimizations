## Overview
This project showcases a cutting-edge microservice architecture designed for scalable integrations across logistic, omni-channel, and partner systems. Utilizing the Spring framework, it supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications, enhancing system efficiency by 50%.

A key feature is the Load Balancer with Round Robin scheduling, enhancing system availability and throughput while reducing downtimes. CI/CD pipelines further streamline deployments across multiple server environments.

Performance is optimized through Time-Aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) caching and ThreadPool executors for swift concurrent IO operations. The architecture also ensures data reliability by managing both SQL and NoSQL databases in primary-replica configurations.

Seamless integrations are achieved with major marketplaces and logistic partners, including Amazon Marketplace and CloudTail, highlighting the system's adaptability and interoperability in dynamic digital ecosystems.

## Architecture

The architecture of this microservice system is designed to maximize scalability, performance, and reliability while ensuring seamless integrations across various platforms. Below is a breakdown of its primary components and their interactions:

#### 1. **Microservice Framework**:
- **Spring**: The backbone of the system, enabling modular service design and facilitating both synchronous and asynchronous communications.
- **Aspect-Driven Architecture**: Captures specific method executions, providing granular control over system behavior.

#### 2. **Load Balancing**:
- **Load Balancer (Round Robin Scheduling)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of services to ensure even load, increased availability, and minimal downtimes.

#### 3. **Performance & Scalability**:
- **TLRU Caching**: An evolved caching mechanism that considers both time and usage, ensuring optimal cache hits and reducing data fetch times.
- **ThreadPool Executors**: Employs a pool of worker threads, facilitating concurrent IO operations, maximizing throughput, and minimizing response times.
- **Aspect, Event, & Annotation-Driven Architectures**: These design patterns further boost system performance by leveraging efficient coding practices.

#### 4. **Data Management**:
- **SQL and NoSQL Databases**: Ensures data reliability and availability by employing a dual-database strategy in primary-replica configurations. This architecture supports both structured and unstructured data needs.
- **Distributed Locking**: Incorporates Zookeeper for ensuring data integrity across microservices.

#### 5. **Integration & Routing**:
- **Marketplace & Logistic Integrations**: The system has connectors to major marketplaces like Amazon Marketplace (SmartConnect & Seller Party models) and logistic partners like CloudTail and Amazon Shipping Provider. These integrations allow for real-time data synchronization and streamlined operations.
- **Dynamic Routing Mechanism**: Efficiently routes requests based on attributes, and custom annotations facilitate internal request routing using Java reflection.

#### 6. **Deployment & Automation**:
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Ensures swift, error-free, and automated deployments across various environments, from development to production.
- **Configuration Manager**: Utilizes `@PropertySources` annotations, enabling real-time configuration updates without system restarts.
- **Environment-Based Properties**: Ensures optimal performance by including properties relevant to the runtime environment.

#### 7. **User Interface & Feedback**:
- **Thymeleaf Template Engine**: Crafts detailed shipping labels and order invoices.
- **Exception Handling**: Leverages ResponseEntityExceptionHandler to ensure RESTful responses during system exceptions.

#### 8. **Request Management**:

- **Request Filter**: Authenticates and routes incoming requests to the correct controllers.

By intertwining modern technologies and innovative design patterns, this architecture assures a harmonious balance between performance, reliability, and scalability. It's primed for future enhancements and integrations with minimal disruptions.
